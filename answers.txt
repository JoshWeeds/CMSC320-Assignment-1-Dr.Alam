Q1: Why might we consider using git?
Answer: It allows for easy collaboration between multiple people, accesability
since one person can work on the same project on different machines, and an
efficient way to see changes and version histories.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an example and how it might help
Answer: One area I see data science used a lot in is in sports, especially
when it comes to scouting young players. By gathering the statistics of younger
players as analytics, professional clubs are better able to see what players
might fit the best for different clubs. An example of a Soccer team that does
this very well is Brighton in the Premier League, they consistently bring in 
young players who excell, and then sell them on for profit.
